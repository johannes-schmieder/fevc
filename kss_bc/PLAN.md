# `kss_bc` living implementation plan

- Plan ID: `KSS-BC-DEV-2026-08`
- Milestone series: KB0--KB6 plus KSS-NUMOPT-1
- Branch/worktree: `main`, current worktree; no branch or worktree creation
- Owner: Johannes
- Start date: 2026-08-14
- Status: active
- Base commit: `2b3bb6b15b6a6d4d638c8ec6e7d3eea8641a7abb`
- Allowed changes for KSS-NUMOPT-1: `kss_bc/**`, `shared/cmg/**`, and
  `cmg_plan.md`; the hash-frozen repository runner remains unchanged
- Protected: `ppml_talo/**`, `application/**`, `software/**`, `paper/**`,
  `theory/**`, `proof-audit/**`, `state/**`, `archive/**`, `paper/releases/**`

## Goal

Build an internal Stata/Mata 18--19 package that implements KSS point-estimate
bias correction for the worker variance, firm variance, worker--firm
covariance, and total variance in a linear two-way fixed-effect model. The
package must support observation and actual-match deletion, exact and improved
JLA algorithms, joint and fixed-offset controls, literal integer-frequency
semantics, target weights, explicit mover/stayer reporting, and production-
shaped matrix-free computation. It remains separate from `ppml_talo` in this
series.

## Fixed inputs and decisions

- Governing requirements: `varcomp_hdfe_specification.md` plus the owner
  decisions recorded in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- Primary behavioral oracle: `rsaggio87/LeaveOutTwoWay` at commit
  `8b957ffeb10b8465a3584fceb0265cccc48379e1`.
- Mathematical sources: KSS (2020), its computational appendix, the authors'
  `doc/improved_JLA.tex`, and the independent derivation in
  `docs/JLA_FINITE_PROJECTION.md`.
- The R package `LeaveOutKSS` 0.1.0 is a secondary translation by Vahid
  Moghani, not an authoritative KSS source.
- The corrected mixed fourth-moment coefficient is one. MATLAB coefficient
  two remains test-only legacy evidence.
- Match-mode headline targets use the mover fit and mover target population.
  A MATLAB-style all-worker hybrid is optional and separately labeled.
- SCC qualification uses public and synthetic data only.

## Milestones

### KB0 — governance, provenance, and independent oracle — COMPLETE

Deliverables: local rules, this plan, public contract, source ledger, exact
symbolic/dense oracle, coefficient-discrepancy test, and clean-install
skeleton.

Exit: Python oracle tests pass; Stata loads the package skeleton; all source
and license boundaries are recorded.

### KB1 — sample, target, graph, and exact estimator — COMPLETE

Deliverables: deterministic ID encoding; sample marking; connected and
leave-out-estimable mover set; deletion blocks; target centering; dense exact
observation/match correction; frequency and target-weight semantics; typed
failures.

Exit: Mata exact results match independent dense and brute-force refit oracles
on registered fixtures, including general within-match controls.

### KB2 — matrix-free fit and inverse actions — COMPLETE

Deliverables: exact worker elimination, full firm-mobility quotient PCG with
post-solve display grounding,
low-dimensional joint-control Schur complement, scalar/batched PCG, quotient
normalization, and recomputed full-system residual checks.

Exit: matrix-free fits and inverse actions match dense systems; no production
path allocates an observation-space matrix.

### KB3 — improved JLA and scalable block deletion — COMPLETE

Deliverables: indexed Rademacher stream, constrained P/M estimates, corrected
fourth moments, block residual-leverage sketches, common target contractions,
batch invariance, conditional numerical MCSE, and literal-frequency probe
aggregation.

Exit: JLA converges to exact targets; seed and batch gates pass; coefficient-
one bias simulation passes; frequency collapse matches literal expansion.

### KB4 — public command, package, and local qualification — COMPLETE

Deliverables: complete ado interface and `e()` contract, help, examples,
failure catalog, internal install bundle, Stata 18 quick/full/install suites,
benchmark drivers, and a package-local qualification runner.

Exit: all local gates pass and the worktree contains no generated logs or
untracked data.

### KB5 — mathematical review — IN PROGRESS

Deliverables: two independent GPT Pro reviews of the finite-projection and
block-control derivations, verbatim records, validation, and local
adjudication.

Exit: no unresolved critical objection; status may advance to `ai_reviewed`
but not `independently_checked`.

### KB6 — SCC public/synthetic qualification — IN PROGRESS

Deliverables: source-bound deployment, Stata 19 portability job, paired
MATLAB/Stata oracle job, synthetic scale ladder, qacct/log/output validation,
collected compact evidence, and a qualification report.

Exit: every accepted job passes scheduler, application, and output gates.
Final status is limited to public/synthetic point-estimation qualification;
restricted-data production and package unification remain open.

### KSS-NUMOPT-1 — lockstep PCG and forced CMG evaluation — LOCAL CANDIDATE

Deliverables: frozen B0 evidence; true lockstep diagonal B1; separated setup,
Schur, preconditioner-application, PCG, leverage, target, and total timings;
per-RHS iteration/residual diagnostics; a memory-rich shared-CMG profile; a
forced test-only KSS adapter; and easy/moderate/weak B1/C benchmarks.

Local outcome: B1 passes estimator and solver equivalence and materially
outperforms B0. Forced C rescues weak graphs and improves moderate 200-RHS
systems, but an easy hierarchy is rejected and the end-to-end estimator,
comparative RSS, and Stata 19 gates are incomplete. Automatic CMG routing is
therefore not implemented; diagonal B1 remains the only installed route.

SCC exit: collect the unchanged B0 job `7185180`; then run a source-bound
short B1 portability/smoke step and inspect scheduler/application/output
evidence before authorizing any larger step. No 12-hour-or-longer submission
is justified automatically. Source commit
`b2ef752684a7f5267aa09e6979700571b5e1b9c0` is staged as SCC run
`20260815T121809Z-b2ef752`. Portability job `7185628` and smoke job `7185639`
pass all three evidence layers in 14 seconds each, with 79,956 KB and 85,568
KB peak RSS. Medium job `7185654` passes in 1,580 seconds with 432,284 KB peak
RSS and a 2.45x end-to-end speedup over frozen scalar B0. Its size/iteration
scaling projects roughly 17.5 hours for large, so large B1 remains unsubmitted.

## Completion gates

- `kss_bc/tests/stata/run_all.do quick`, `full`, and clean install pass on
  Stata 18.
- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest kss_bc/tests/python -q` passes.
- `./.venv/bin/python kss_bc/tools/run_checks.py` and the repository
  `tools/run_checks.py --scope full` pass.
- Exact, JLA, controls, deletion, frequency, target, mover/stayer, accounting,
  failure, invariance, and reproducibility tests pass.
- Required Pro reviews are stored and adjudicated.
- SCC Stata 19 evidence passes the three-layer acceptance rule.
- No protected path changed; public release remains blocked by licensing.
