# fevc

`fevc` estimates bias-corrected variance components in worker–firm fixed-effects
models in Stata, using the leave-out approach of Kline, Saggio, and Sølvsten.
It reports worker-effect variance, firm-effect variance, their covariance,
and the variance of their combined contribution.

The command supports controls, frequency weights, and match or observation
deletion. It provides exact calculation for small problems and a randomized
approximation for larger datasets, with a native Rust backend for supported
requests. Point estimation is the default; inference is available for
[supported models](fevc/docs/INFERENCE.md).

## Requirements

- Stata 18 or 19.
- The planned binary distribution supports macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel),
  Linux x86-64, and Windows x86-64, without a compiler or Rust installation.

## Installation

The complete binary distribution is being prepared. The commands below are
the intended public installation routes and are **not yet available**.
See the [installation status](INSTALLATION.md) for current availability.

```stata
net install fevc, replace ///
    from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johannes-schmieder/fevc/main/")
```

If you already use the Stata `github` command:

```stata
github install johannes-schmieder/fevc
```

Both routes will install the command, help, and precompiled native backend.

## Example

With worker–firm panel data loaded:

```stata
* Bias-corrected worker–firm variance decomposition
fevc log_wage, worker(worker_id) firm(firm_id)

* Include year effects
fevc log_wage i.year, worker(worker_id) firm(firm_id)

* Show uncorrected estimates, estimated bias, and corrected components
estat decomposition, full
```

Match deletion is the default. The displayed decomposition separates worker,
firm, and sorting contributions; sorting is twice the worker–firm covariance.

To run a self-contained example with simulated data:

```stata
fevc_run exact_controls using fevc.sthlp
```

This example restores your data when it finishes. See `help fevc` for syntax,
options, and more examples, or read the [usage guide](fevc/README.md).
